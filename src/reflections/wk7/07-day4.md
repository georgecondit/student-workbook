Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
Personally, I did a lot of thinking about UI, and I also spent a lot of time watching and partner programming. 

What went well? I didn't really feel I had much to contribute being the odd man out and  voluntarily re-assigned, which I'm really glad for both Ahley and myself, because we wouldn't have made it without some serious help. I'm really impressed by Alex Foster and Chris Curry. Those guys have a really good handle on this on the full stack. I hope I can pull this off. 

What would you do differently? I think we, as a team, should have spent more time planning how we were going to spend our time. I also think we should have concentrated on each piece more as a team, but we lost some time on the issues that occurred during Jake's session on nested
data. Those bugs were really tough. That kind of forced us to split our efforts on stying and functionality, which took me away from the areas where I'm weak.

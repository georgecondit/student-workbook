What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#? 

Inheritance allows us to set a base model and use everything with in that model in children of that model. THis allows for the customiztion of model using subclasses. 

How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class? Basically the child calss inherits all the properties of the parent class except for the constuctors. Its works much the same as controller extending the contrtoller base.

How does accessibility affect inheritance? If a parent class has private properties, they will not be passed to a child.

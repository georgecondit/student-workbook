What is the purpose of Async/Await?
They were introduced to remove call back hell. They make debugging easier because the debugger will look at those calls as if the code was syncronous. They also allow for multiple chained functions which are much easier to read.

What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?

Use the key word await before (or prepend await to the code that must execute)

What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

Making  debugging, reading code easier. Reduce callback hell.


//NOTE   I just want you all to know that if I don't get through this check point that I will keep trying.
I've made a good start and I know way more already than I thought I ever would about coding and how to 
create code. I really appreciate all that you have shown me, and helped me to learn about myself. This experience was 
especially good for me because in my previous life as a Massage Therapist had no community aspect to it at all.
I forgot how much I missed being part of a group of people working together toward a common goal.

Thank you, Boise Codeworks!

# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
<!-- Async code lets other activities and tasks happen when your computer is doing something else. Synchronous code is running line by line -->
in order. 
```
**2.** What is an event listener?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
<!-- An event listener is a class that tells the app to do something when something else happens. Save this when it changes, draw this when it changes. -->
```
**3.** What does the `O` represent in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
<!-- Open for extention and closed for modification. It means that the function should be available to other needs, and shouldn't change or be 
modified. -->
```
**4.** What is a callback / higher order function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
<!-- A call back is when the code declaares a function but doesn't invoke it until some other function has happened.  -->
```
**5.** What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
<!-- A promise is when you send a request for something to server and the response must be fulfilled, rejected or it's pending. Either way it will be resolved or rejected. The error can be captured with the try catch methods. 
```
**6.** Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
The request line, the headers, and the body of the request (normally used to pass form parameters). 
=======
one can use get, post, put and delete

```
**7.** What does the `API` acronym stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Application Programming Interface
```
**8.** In the `MVC` design pattern, who is responsible for making calls to `APIs`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Within the Api Service file there is a class that sends the get requeset to the api, then the consructor declares the function and it is called by an actual separate function in the API class where it is then invoked by the constructor
=======
the sservice
>>>>>>> 6fa06b8461d85ce640b0a3b544505ea4263f5916

```
**9.** What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
The purpose of encapsulation is to create layers of security to keep sotred information safe on the host server. Encapsulation also maintains modularization of the application so that it can be reused without be repeated elsewhere
=======
 to keep things separate
>>>>>>> 6fa06b8461d85ce640b0a3b544505ea4263f5916
```
**10.** What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
200 my favorite is 218 though
```
**11.** What is a 500 error?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It means that some condition of the request prevented the server from sending a response that fulfills the promise.

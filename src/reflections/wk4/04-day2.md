What are the three states of a Promise?
The three states of a promise are pending(waiting for the server to respond), resolved(the promise has been kept), and
rejected(the request to the server was rejected)

How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
    To resolve the issues with callback hell, promises seek to make code more readable. Promises also allow you to write code in the form of a call back that will run a declared function once the callback has finished it's task. So one function invokes another once some-
    thing is done.


What is the difference between .then() and .catch()? 
The method .then() is used to do something with a resolved promises. .catch is used
to do something else if the promise is rejected.

What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?
    A sign of Callback Hell is the pyramid shape of the code with line after line of )} at the end. It is cause by people
    writing code that is not taking advantage of async code. We want to do other things while we're retrieving data
    reading files and generally waiting for something else to happen.




What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved? 
    Asynchronous means that functions are declared but they may not run until something else e.g(like a database returning a bunch of cat pictures) Call backs allow for a function to be declared but must wait to run until that other activity is done. 


Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell

Keep code "shallow" -it makes ease of reading better. Functions are named so exceptions are not anonymous. And they can be referenced by name.

Modularize - split code up in to different files that each do only one thing. 

Handle every single error = expect platform errors so that your code is hardened agains them so that code is stable.

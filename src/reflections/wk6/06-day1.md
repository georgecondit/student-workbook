What is Component based architecture?

CBA was developed by facebook to be able to have seperate components in a web based application. Chat windows, feeds, and pages 
all operate independently of each other and remain present on page load. 

What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
CBA allows the user to have several different experiences on the web app. Each one can make for a robust UI. Components also exist within their
own architecture and have their own Api's and methods. 

What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture? Clutter. While CBA supports single responsibility and encapsulation
there is the possibility that the readability of the code can become degraded. It shouldn't be used for the entire application because there are better ways to do other things without using a component.


NOTE // Week 6. It's hard to believe that we are almost halfway through this course. I still feel lost on a lot of it. I'll get there.
Stay strong and keep moving forward. That's literally all I can do. Keep trying!

What is a nested route?
A nested rout is when you have information flowing through compnents within components that are sitting with in another component. Think User, User Profile, User comments all being nested within thier parent element. 

When might you use a nested route? (other than the 
provided example) Nest elements may be necessary when you need to use authentication for put, post and delete commands where it is necessary that the person making those requests has proper authorization to do so. Now the information regarding the authorization must flow down through each component to ensure the security of the app.

Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them? Yes. As mentioned above. You can pass authentication keys through the layers to ensure proper authority for requests.

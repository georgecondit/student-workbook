What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Life cycle hooks are a look behind the scenes at what is going on in Vue. They allow you to know what when a component has been created, read, edited and deleted.



How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

In the nasa apod project we have used creation hooks to set up the rendering of input as well as set up the api calls to get the information that
will be rendered to the DOM upon user input. At this point events and lifecycle have been initialized.




What are mounting hooks? When might you use them? Mounting hooks are used to manipulate data before or after data is run through crud methods and 
mounted to the DOM. They allow you to manipulate data before or after they are mounted and can be used to record information that is changed or destroyed. Perhaps they could be used to record information that has been deleted so that it can be recovered if necessary.

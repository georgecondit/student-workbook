What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?
    I could use console.log() in JS.  The console tab in the dev tools will also allow you to write directly in the console.


Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
    The source tab allows you to see those elements. It also allow you to select different elements and inspect them from each line of code.


Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code? 
    I would use the debugger. This allow a developer to follow each step the code is taking and help them determine if there is a problem.





function evenOrOdd(num) {
    return (num % 2 == 0) 
}

console.log(evenOrOdd(21))
console.log(evenOrOdd(2))
console.log(evenOrOdd(0))
console.log(evenOrOdd(-1))
console.log(evenOrOdd(-2))

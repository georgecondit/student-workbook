What is Scope ? 
scope is what can be seen or used by a function. Variables defined within the braces of a function are locally scoped and globally scoped if outside the confines of a function's block of code.

What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is when declared variables are brought to top of the scope. A variable can be declared, but not defined, and when it is defined that value is put in the memory slot held by that binding or variable. 

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var? I want to use var and const globally, and let locally. "let"'s variable can have it's assignment adjusted by the inner workings of a function. It may start as 0 and change throughout the working of the program.

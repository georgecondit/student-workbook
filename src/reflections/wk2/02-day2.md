What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
1. Use let to declare a variable and assign it to a function. (function expression)
2. Use keywork function and function name with argument/s to write a function. (function declaration)
3. Use  the keyword const with function name and  = () => { } syntax to declare a function. (anonymous function) - the arrow function doesn't create its execution context.
What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments? 
    Parameters are undefined variables that the function needs to operate.
    Arguments are when those variables have been defined.

What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example? 

A higher order function is one that relies on other pre-writen functions in order to execute.
One function changes another. 

Example: 
function getRange() {
    
}

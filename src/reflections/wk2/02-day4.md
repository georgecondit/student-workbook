What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code? The benefits of planning are that you've thought about, researched, and re-thought about the problems you are trying to solve and you've thought about the solutions and ways to solve the problems. 

How do you find answers when you are stuck? If stuck, give up and ask Darryl, never! Google it. Look at w3schools and stackOverFlow and look for code that has already been written. I mean, why reinvent the wheel. Giants have shoulders for a reason. 

From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
I don't know shit. I am a complete and utter newbie. Stay humble, keep trying and you'll get there.


Deep Thoughts:

I saw a billboard. It said it's cookie time. I didn;t think about Girlscouts, but that is what it was for. I thought it was asking me to accept cookies on the web site. It wasn't. 

Anyway, I was thinking about writing a fictional story that includes coding in the story. Perhaps something about a guy who figures out that everything he does is based on a function. The main character realizes that he is acturlly going through code lines as he makes some over-easy eggs. 

function cookEggs(eggQuant) {
    getKnife()
    getFork()
    useKnife()

    if(eggQuant == 1) {grabSmPan()}
    breakEgg()

    
}

and so on.

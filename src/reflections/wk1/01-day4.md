What is the purpose of wire-framing?
    the purpose of wire framing is to give the developer a template so that he/she can have some idea of what they want to accomplish when they start developing the website. It is basically a guide.


What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful? I'm not sure we went over this. It's seemed like we were just checking out the figma tool, which allowed the dev to go into as much or as little detail as required by the complexity required by the product owner. 


Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not? They are worth the TEE. When you have multiple people working on one site, everyone will have a guide to go by. It can also be used to split up the work so that two devs don't work on the same piece of the pie.

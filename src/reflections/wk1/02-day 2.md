What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

    Pseudo-Class is a way to affect the DOM with actions like hovering over an object or changing an object from clicked or unclicked, or links that have been visited. Hover will probably be the most used.

What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit? 
    Specificity determines which CSS attribute will be executed based on its rank against other CSS selectors.  I might use the specificity to determine if a selector is used over another depending on how important it is in the execution of the particular attribute.

What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
    Over use of !important can cause the specificity to be so high that the code will not execute properly.
    Overcoming it's specificity may be impossible.

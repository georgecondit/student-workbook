How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    Good design has great form an function. The website can be pretty, but if it doesn't work properly it will get bounced. It is especially important in relation to what the person or company is trying to accomplish. Even amazon has a tough time with this. There are places along the sales funnel where you can't do certian things(ie add specific instructions for package delivery) and it becomes very frustrating for the user.

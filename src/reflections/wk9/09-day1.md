What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We are using a framework, Vue. Jquery for modals, bootstrap for styling and structure. We are using Firebase for uploading photos, restful conventions, the solid principles. We are also trying to keep our components small and compact so that we can use them in various places. 

What went well so far? The best part of this project is that we are doing something that is very real-world and could be actually used by a property management company to make thier jobs easier. Getting the basics down first has gone quite well. 
Having a project to take from like Buglog has been quite useful. 


What would you do differently? Why? I think we should have spent another whole or at least half a day talking about the flow of data through the app, an how it would be used. It would have also helped us not waste time on a data schema that we wound up not using and discarding.

How might Scrum for a small team differ from Scrum for a large team? 
NOTE //I edited this question to make it more understanable

    In a smaller team the SM would need to reduce the meeting time so that the team would be free to do their jobs. In a larger team where there is more man-power, it is easier to break down sprints into smaller components. In the article this is considered expanding the "scope of communications". Also because of the stress of quickly approaching deadlines for MVP delivery, the SM needs to be more involved in helping a team member stay on task, whereas a larger team may have the resources to help each other stay focused on product delivery.



Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

    Software development lends itself to a step by step process. One step at a time will help developers stay focused on the task at hand. 

What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

    Fast - cheap - good. If you want something good, you shouldn't try to do it fast or cheap and if you want it fast it will niether be cheap or good, and if you want something cheap, it will be cheap but it won't be fast(in the long run), and it will wind up costing you more in the long run. If the team understands this paradox, then they will be better served in a scrum envoronment where small amount of work are done one sprint at a time.

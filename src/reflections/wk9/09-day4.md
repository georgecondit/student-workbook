What is an SSL certificate? It is a small piece of code that binds the server and the browser using encription that ensures that the communication between the two is kept private. It stands for secure socket layer. 

What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for? The types of SSL are Extended, Organizational, and Domain Validation, and WildCard. Extended is the most stringent in terms of how much checking the Certifying Authority does to validate ownership of your website. It is also the most expensive to obtain and keep current. Organizationtial is more for domains and subdomains that will be validated by the CA and also that the website was operating leagally. Domain Validation SSL offers a low level of encryption, and secures only the main domain, subdomains are not included in the certificate.
WildCard offers some encryption but will also cover subdomains.

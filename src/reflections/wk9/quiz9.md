**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 In this design pattern you make one class that will create child classes that have different attributes. This will allow for the expansion of your code later should you decide to add more features to your app. Because the main constuctor now helps you create other objects your code doesn't need to be re-written everytime you add a new feature.
```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
write the test, write the code, test it, then refactor the code so it is super simple and then test it again. Test Driven Development is designed to get to the simplest piece of code and have it work quickly.

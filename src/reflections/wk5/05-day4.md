What is a virtual property?

A virtual property is one that only exists in the document, but is not printed to the document's collection. They can also be used for functionality. 

When might you use a virtual property?

When you want to identify a person in their profile, but only expose thier user name to the public. An ID on a the last child might 
not ever get published to the collection, but could be used for a relationship model. Virtuals do not work for queries. Only non-
virtual are used for field selection or queries.



How do you search by a virtual properties value?
Virtuals do not work for queries. Only non-virtual are used for field selection or queries.

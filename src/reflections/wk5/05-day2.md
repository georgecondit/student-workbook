What are the three types of relationships?
1. One to One, 1:1
2. One to Many, 1:N
3, Many to Many, N:M

What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding

Linking keeps the information separate, and is only accessable at the aplication level because MongoDB doesn't 
enforce foreign key constraints.

Embedding allows the relationship to come from a single document. This is a single request, and preferred.

What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

N:M relationships are difficult to manage because of the volume of information and decisions arount how to access the information
are based on the commonalities of the informatin itself. Some identifiers will have many identifieds and vice versa. The goal of all this is 
to make the information efficiently manageable. The challenge is going to be how to reduce the number of requests it takes to get the
information needed.

In simple terms what is a sub-document?
 A sub-document is a document within another document. One might thin of it as a parent-child relationship. Or an object that is nested in another object.

When might you use a sub-document?
One mught use a sub-document to embed more key/value pairs into a parent document when there are many categories that fall within that parent. It is useful when an object needs to be more defined in the database or when you're trying to assign more properties to the parent objec.

How do you add to a collection of sub-documents? What about editing them? 

First you have to findOne. Then you have to Edit the one you found then you have to replace the old one with the new one. It is helpful if the child is in an array so that it can be referenced by it's index under the parent name.


NOTE I'm really having fun with this. It seems to be getting easier, finally. I really love the challenge and I look forward to working in an industry with the calibre of people that embody this class.

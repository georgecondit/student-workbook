What is the purpose of a Query String?
The Query string lets you pass information to and from a website by adding or appending inofrmation to the end of the URL.
This information can be used for anything including methods.


What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

A query parameter is appended to the end of an address using the syntax, " ?name=bob". It can also be scaled to include more than one
parameter using the & symbol.


When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server? Query parameters would be helpful to CRUD any information 
stored in your database or api that you need to manipulate for presentation dynamically on the DOM. Searching for unique values and relationships in the sought information can be access using such a query. I would imagine it would be quite useful for the medical field 
where you're dealing with massive amounts of information to look for correlations and relationships in the data. 

NOTE 
Journal Note - these last few week have been extremely difficult. I know the school has spent years trying to perfect the coursework. It shows
I'm up for the challenge and am more committed to seeing this through to the end point of actually working in this industry. I do have to admit that I am tired. I haven't worked this hard mentally since Russian school. But I am a work horse. I can go and go and go. I'll sleep when I'm 
dead.

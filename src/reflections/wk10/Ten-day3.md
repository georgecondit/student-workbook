What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them? Enums are strongly typed constants. They allow the use of meaningful identifiers to atatch meaning to integral values. Because they are used symbolically they make for readable code. You might use an enum to describe an integer as in a longitude or latitude, or the name of a city to describe a location.

How can you modify an Enum? There are several methods in the enum BCL that allow you to change the type of the stongly typed constants, but they must be explicitly cast to the new type. In this regard one must be careful to ensure that no data is lost in the conversion. 

How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could) In the RPS project, one could use enums to assign values to each of the choices so that evaluation of the computer choice and the player choice could be compared mathmatically to declare a win, loss or tie. In the slap game one could use enums to assign  values to each of the 'attacks' perpetrated on the opponent. As such they could be used to increase or decrease a "Score" value. As with any situation where you need to assign names to values so that they can be manipulated in the business logic modules of the program. enums could be useful.

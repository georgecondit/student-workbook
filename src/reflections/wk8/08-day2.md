Why is communication on a small team important?
Small teams work well for development when they communicate. I liken this capstone situation to playing a sport. Communication is very important when trying to reach a goal as a team. Without it, the team wouldn't be able to know what the other players are doing. In coding this would equal wasted time and effort, and the goals of the project may never be met because time is a factor in this situation. 

What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
Individuals have strengths and weaknesses when it comes to skill sets. It makes sense to play to these strenghts when decisions are made about responsibility for parts of the work to be accomplished. Once the core of a project has been completed, it makes sense for people to help out where they can, especially where some part of the project is at a point where something else needs to be done before that peice can proceed.

What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
 Fast - cheap - good. If you want something good, you shouldn't try to do it fast or cheap and if you want it fast it will niether be cheap or good, and if you want something cheap, it will be cheap but it won't  be fast(in the long run), and it will wind up costing you more in the long run.

What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
 1. the get operation
 2. the set operation


What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?
    one needs to make sure that the key and value are being passed as params for the get function. THis sets the 
    trap so that the get will always return a value and not be 'undefined'. 



What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
A proxy object allows us to creat a fail-safe so that we know when someone has tired to access a piece of information
We can also create a custom validation to only allow those with proper credentials to access the requested information.

 Today was rough. I really have to give a huge shout out to Harrison for being such a great help to me today. 
 He always has the patience and kindly way about him when I'm having problems. He always has a great attitude about
 what he's doing. Thanks Harrison!

What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

THe purpose of encapsulation is to provide security in our web application. They allow us to separate 
our in the layer of our files so that it is more difficult for a user to alter information or functions that we
code.

What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix? Underscore prefixes let coders know that 
this function is supposed to be a private funciotn. It's actual functions are performed at a different layer of the 
MVC architecture so that that manipulation is kept private, but some developers are not familliar with the syntactical 
convention so information that should be kept private is leaked to layers with less protection. Closures will use information
from an outer lexical environment to perform their activities, and thereby provide a greater area of exposure to bad actors.
